# 1. First C# code

## C# Intro
With C#, you can build:
- Business apps to capture/analyze/process data
- Dynamic web apps
- 2D/3D Games
- Financial & scientific apps
- Cloud-based apps
- Mobile apps

C# is case-sensitive. 

```cs
// write a newline afterwards
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

// Continue to write to the current line
Console.Write("Congratulations!");
Console.Write(" ");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");
```

Compile: compiler converts your source code into a format that the computer's CPU can execute. Syntax highlighting help you easily spot mistakes.
